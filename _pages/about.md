I am a graduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science. My current research focuses on several exciting areas, including feature engineering, graph networks, and time series forecasting.

I am passionate about exploring how these technologies can be leveraged to solve real-world problems, and I am eager to continue deepening my knowledge and skills in these fields.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my homepage.
